## Assignment description:

	For this project, you will build a message generator program. Every time a user
	runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output. Youâ€™re welcome to take
	the project in a couple of different forms, like an astrology generator, 
	inspirational message, or nonsensical jokes. To make your program truly 
	random, the message that it outputs should be made up of at least three 
	different pieces of data. Take what you know of JavaScript syntax so far
	to build the program and customize it to your liking.

## My idea:
When the program is run, it prints a randomized text message from a friend in need of a little help to the console.

Examples:


	What's up. So, I started riding this horse last week. Long story short, now I'm enlisted for 12 years with the French foreign legion. Do you mind mailing me a copy of your birth certificate? Thanks duder.


	Hey bro, I took the wrong flight 4 days ago. Things happened, now I'm wanted for turtle murder in Hawaii. Would you please send me a Facebook message pretending I'm the sultan of Sudan? Many thanks broseph.


	What up chicka! I got drunk and blacked out last night. Long story short, now my mother is being held hostage by the Girl Scout militia of Alabama! Can you mail me 9 black socks? I'd appreciate it, bro!
