	Codecademy.com - Full Stack Path - "Mixed Messages" assignment
	https://www.codecademy.com/paths/full-stack-engineer-career-path/tracks/fscp-javascript-syntax-portfolio-project/modules/fscp-mixed-messages/kanban_projects/mixed-messages
	For this project, you will build a message generator program. Every time a user
	runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output. Youâ€™re welcome to take
	the project in a couple of different forms, like an astrology generator, 
	inspirational message, or nonsensical jokes. To make your program truly 
	random, the message that it outputs should be made up of at least three 
	different pieces of data. Take what you know of JavaScript syntax so far
	to build the program and customize it to your liking.

	Idea: Randomized text message from a friend in need of a little help...
